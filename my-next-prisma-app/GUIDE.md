## 5. Core Flows

Understanding how data and interactions flow through the system is crucial for development and debugging. Here are the main flows:

---

### **1. User Authentication Flow**

**User Journey:**
1. User visits QuizMania
2. Clicks "Sign In" or "Join Game"
3. Clerk handles OAuth (Google, Discord, etc.)
4. User is redirected back with session token
5. User can now access multiplayer features

**Code Flow:**
```
User clicks sign in
├── Clerk OAuth flow
├── Session token stored in cookies
├── User data fetched via tRPC
├── Zustand auth store updated
└── User redirected to multiplayer arena
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Clerk → Session Token → Next.js API → tRPC → Prisma → PostgreSQL
```

**Security Considerations:**
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Session validation on every request

---

### **2. Multiplayer Room Join Flow**

**User Journey:**
1. User enters multiplayer arena
2. Sees available rooms or creates new one
3. Selects game mode and settings
4. Joins room and sees other players
5. Voice chat automatically connects
6. Ready to start game

**Code Flow:**
```
User joins room
├── Socket.IO connection established
├── Room state fetched from Redis
├── User added to room in WebSocket server
├── LiveKit token generated for voice
├── Voice connection established
├── Room state broadcast to all users
└── UI updates with real-time data
```

**Real-time Flow:**
```
Client → Socket.IO → WebSocket Server → Redis → Broadcast to Room
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Frontend → Socket.IO → Redis (room state) → PostgreSQL (persistent data)
```

**Error Handling:**
- Connection retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket fails
- Graceful degradation if voice chat unavailable
- Room state recovery on reconnection

---

### **3. Chat System Flow**

**User Journey:**
1. User types message in chat
2. Message appears immediately (optimistic update)
3. Message sent to server via Socket.IO
4. Server validates and broadcasts to room
5. Other users receive message in real-time
6. Message stored in database for persistence

**Code Flow:**
```
User types message
├── Optimistic update in UI
├── Socket.IO emit to server
├── Server validation and processing
├── Broadcast to room members
├── Database storage (if persistent)
└── UI confirmation/error handling
```

**Real-time Flow:**
```
User → Socket.IO → Server → Redis Pub/Sub → All Room Members
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Chat Input → Zustand Store → Socket.IO → Redis → PostgreSQL
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Message batching for high-frequency chats
- Virtual scrolling for large chat histories
- Message compression for bandwidth efficiency
- Caching of recent messages in Redis

---

### **4. Voice Chat Flow**

**User Journey:**
1. User joins room with voice enabled
2. LiveKit token generated on server
3. WebRTC connection established
4. User can speak and hear others
5. Push-to-talk or always-on modes
6. Voice quality indicators shown

**Code Flow:**
```
Voice connection
├── LiveKit token request to API
├── Token generation with room permissions
├── WebRTC connection establishment
├── Audio stream processing
├── Voice activity detection
└── Quality metrics collection
```

**Real-time Flow:**
```
User → WebRTC → LiveKit → TURN Servers → Other Users
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Voice Input → WebRTC → LiveKit Cloud → WebRTC → Other Users
```

**Quality Assurance:**
- Automatic fallback to lower quality if needed
- Packet loss monitoring and reporting
- Echo cancellation and noise reduction
- Bandwidth adaptation based on connection

---

### **5. Game State Management Flow**

**User Journey:**
1. Host starts game with selected mode
2. Game state synchronized across all players
3. Questions appear simultaneously
4. Answers submitted and validated
5. Results calculated and displayed
6. Leaderboard updated in real-time

**Code Flow:**
```
Game start
├── Game mode schema validation
├── Questions fetched from database
├── Game state initialized in Redis
├── State broadcast to all players
├── Timer synchronization
├── Answer collection and validation
├── Score calculation
└── Results broadcast and storage
```

**Real-time Flow:**
```
Host → Socket.IO → Server → Redis → All Players
```

**Data Flow:**
```
Game State → Redis (temporary) → PostgreSQL (permanent)
```

**Consistency Guarantees:**
- Atomic state updates in Redis
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous actions
- State recovery on player reconnection
- Audit trail for tournament integrity

### **6. Clan System Flow**

**User Journey:**
1. User creates or joins clan
2. Clan chat becomes available
3. Clan events can be scheduled
4. Members can invite others
5. Clan leader manages permissions
6. Clan statistics tracked over time

**Code Flow:**
```
Clan operations
├── Clan creation/join validation
├── Member permissions checked
├── Clan state updated in database
├── Real-time updates to members
├── Event scheduling and notifications
└── Statistics aggregation
```

**Real-time Flow:**

### **9. Error Handling and Recovery**

**Common Error Scenarios:**
1. **Network Disconnection**
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - State recovery from Redis
   - User notification of connection status

2. **Server Failure**
   - Health checks and automatic failover
   - Graceful degradation of features
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Data Inconsistency**
   - Conflict resolution algorithms
   - State validation and correction
   - Audit logging for debugging

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Automatic scaling based on load
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Performance optimization triggers

**Recovery Strategies:**
- **State Recovery:** Redis snapshots and database backups
- **Connection Recovery:** Automatic reconnection with state sync
- **Data Recovery:** Transaction rollback and consistency checks
- **User Experience:** Graceful degradation and clear messaging

### **10. Performance and Scaling Flows**

**Load Balancing:**
- Multiple WebSocket server instances
- Redis clustering for state distribution
- Database connection pooling
- CDN for static assets

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis for session and room state
- TanStack Query for API response caching
- Browser caching for static resources
- CDN caching for global assets

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Automated alerting for critical issues
- Performance trend analysis

**Scaling Triggers:**
- CPU usage > 70%
- Memory usage > 80%
- Response time > 500ms
- Error rate > 1%

These flows ensure the system is robust, scalable, and provides an excellent user experience even under high load or when errors occur.
